class DataProductMetadata:
    """Class to load or create metadata for the given data products.

    Refer to https://confluence.skatelescope.org/display/SWSI/\
    ADR-55+Definition+of+metadata+for+data+management+at+AA0.5
    for additional details related to conventions used in the class.

    For a given data product a set of rules are followed to load its associated metadata file.
    If a metadata file cannot be found then metadata is generated for the data product in order
    that the data products can be stored with a minimal set of metadata.

    The rules followed for searching for a metadata file are:
    * If data product is a file then look in the same directory as the data product for a file
    with the name ```config.METADATA_FILENAME```
    * If data product is a directory then look inside that same directory for a file with the
    name ```config.METADATA_FILENAME```
    * minimal_metadata_generator is used to generate metadata if a metadata file cannot be found.

    NOTE: Any created metadata is held in this class and written out to disk as DLM client only
    needs it to register the data product.

    The found metadata file must:
    * be YAML compliant
    * contain only a single dictionary document
    * use only the JSON subset of YAML values

    This is similar to https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-dataproduct-metadata
    but is SDP specific hence it is not the preferred option here.
