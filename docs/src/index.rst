Introduction
=============


Welcome to ska-dlm-client's documentation (*WIP*)! The ``ska_dlm_client`` package provides high-level client tools for interacting with the `SKA Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) system <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-data-lifecycle/en/latest/overview/index.html>`_,
supporting the ingestion of data products along with their associated metadata.

Two supported clients are available:

- **Directory Watcher Client**: A general-purpose tool that monitors a specified directory and ingests new data products as they appear, automatically triggering migration.

- **ConfigDB Watcher Client**: A tool that monitors the `Configuration Database <https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp/ska-sdp-config>`_ for data-product Flows with a COMPLETED status and ingests data products located under the specified pvc_path, automatically triggering migration.

Both clients interact with the DLM via its autogenerated OpenAPI-based REST interface.

Please note the **Kafka Client** is now deprecated (superseded by the ConfigDB Watcher).
