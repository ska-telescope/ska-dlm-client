Introduction

*Work In Progress*


Welcome to ska-dlm-client's documentation! The ``ska_dlm_client`` package provides high-level client tools for interacting with the `SKA Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) system <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-data-lifecycle/en/latest/overview/index.html>`_,
supporting the ingestion of data products along with their associated metadata.

Two supported clients are available:

- **Directory Watcher Client**: A general-purpose tool that monitors a specified directory and ingests new data products as they appear.

- **ConfigDB Watcher Client**: A tool that monitors the Configuration Database for data-product Flows with a COMPLETED status and ingests data products located under the specified pvc_path.

Both clients are built on top of the autogenerated OpenAPI-based DLM REST interface.

Please note the **Kafka Client** is now deprecated.
