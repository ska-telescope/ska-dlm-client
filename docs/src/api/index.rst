ska_dlm_client Package
======================

The ``ska_dlm_client`` package provides two high-level clients for interacting with the
`SKA Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) system <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-data-lifecycle/en/latest/overview/index.html>`_.
These clients facilitate the ingestion of data products along with their associated metadata.

The two supported clients are:

- **Directory Watcher Client**: A general-purpose tool that monitors a specified directory
  and ingests new data products as they appear.

- **ConfigDB Watcher Client**: A tool that monitors the Configuration Database for data-product Flows with a COMPLETED status,
  and ingests new data products under the given pvc_path.

- Note the **Kafka Client** is now deprecated.

Both clients are built on top of the autogenerated OpenAPI-based DLM REST interface.

.. note::
   Direct use of the OpenAPI REST interface is not recommended for typical workflows. However, documentation for advanced users who wish to interface with it directly is available in the :doc:`../openapi_readme`.
