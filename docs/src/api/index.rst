ska_dlm_client Package
======================

The ska_dlm_client package provides two clients for the `SKA Data Lifecycle Managment system (DLM) <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-data-lifecycle/en/latest/overview/index.html>`_, enabling ingestion of data products and their associated metadata. The Kafka client is being used in operations to ingest visibility data products created by the SDP receive pipeline, the Directory Watcher client is used in a more generic way to watch a configured directory and ingest new products as soon as they appear there. These two clients are based on the autogenerated openAPI DLM REST interface. Directly interfacing with the REST openAPI is not recommended, but it is described in the :doc:`../openapi_readme` documentation for advanced use cases.
