ska_dlm_client Package
======================

The ``ska_dlm_client`` package provides two high-level clients for interacting with the 
`SKA Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) system <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-data-lifecycle/en/latest/overview/index.html>`_.
These clients facilitate the ingestion of data products along with their associated metadata.

The two supported clients are:

- **Kafka Client**: In operations, this client ingests visibility data products generated by the SDP receive pipeline.

- **Directory Watcher Client**: A more general-purpose client that monitors a configured directory and automatically ingests new data products as they appear.

Both clients are built on top of the autogenerated OpenAPI-based DLM REST interface.

.. note::
   Direct use of the OpenAPI REST interface is not recommended for typical workflows. However, documentation for advanced users who wish to interface with it directly is available in the :doc:`../openapi_readme`.
