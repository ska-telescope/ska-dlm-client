# SKA DLM Integration Environment

* This is a work in progress*

The templates provided allow for the setup/creation of the following compoenents of a
system integration environment:

* PVCs - one each for daq, pst and sdp.
* PVC - one for the destination storage endpoint.
* ssh key secrets - one for each component of the system. They are taken from the files/keys
  directory. See the README.md in that directory for more details.
